# Feature: Streaming & Protocol Support

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-featstatus-streaming-implemented`

<!-- reference to DECOMPOSITION entry -->
- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-cf-oagw-feature-streaming`

## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Extend the base HTTP proxy engine with SSE (Server-Sent Events), WebSocket, and WebTransport streaming support, including proper connection lifecycle management and adaptive HTTP version negotiation with protocol version caching.

### 1.2 Purpose

Many external APIs use SSE for streaming responses (e.g., OpenAI chat completions); WebSocket and WebTransport are needed for bidirectional real-time protocols. This feature extends the proxy flow defined in `cpt-cf-oagw-feature-proxy-engine` with streaming-aware connection handling. Covers `cpt-cf-oagw-fr-streaming`.

Design component: `cpt-cf-oagw-interface-api` (streaming variant of the proxy endpoint).

Design principles enforced (inherited from `cpt-cf-oagw-feature-proxy-engine`): `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-error-source`, `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-no-retry`, `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-cred-isolation`.

Design constraints enforced: `cpt-cf-oagw-constraint-https-only`.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### SSE Proxy Flow

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-flow-streaming-sse`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-oagw-actor-app-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- SSE connection is established to upstream and events are forwarded to the caller in real time

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### HTTP Version Negotiation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-protocol-version-negotiation`

**Input**: Upstream endpoint host/IP, requested protocol (SSE/WebSocket/WebTransport)

**Output**: Negotiated HTTP version (HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2) or error

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Compute cache key: `{scheme}://{host}:{port}` - `inst-proto-1`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** protocol version cache contains entry for this key AND entry is not expired (TTL: 1 hour) - `inst-proto-2`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** cached HTTP version - `inst-proto-2a`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Attempt TLS handshake with ALPN extension offering `h2` (HTTP/2) and `http/1.1` - `inst-proto-3`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** ALPN negotiation selects `h2` - `inst-proto-4`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Cache entry: `{key} → HTTP/2, expires_at = now + 1h` - `inst-proto-4a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** HTTP/2 - `inst-proto-4b`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **ELSE** (ALPN selects `http/1.1` or ALPN not supported) - `inst-proto-5`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Cache entry: `{key} → HTTP/1.1, expires_at = now + 1h` - `inst-proto-5a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** HTTP/1.1 - `inst-proto-5b`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** TLS handshake fails entirely - `inst-proto-6`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** error: connection failed (502 DownstreamError) - `inst-proto-6a`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** cached version fails at runtime (e.g., HTTP/2 connection error on a host cached as HTTP/2) - `inst-proto-7`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Evict cache entry for this key - `inst-proto-7a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Re-negotiate from step 3 on next request (not current request — no retry per `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-no-retry`) - `inst-proto-7b`

### Streaming Connection Lifecycle

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-streaming-connection-lifecycle`

**Input**: Established streaming connection (SSE, WebSocket, or WebTransport), idle timeout configuration

**Output**: Connection managed through open/active/closing/closed phases with proper resource cleanup

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Initialize connection state: `OPEN` - `inst-lifecycle-1`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Start idle timer with configured timeout (from upstream/route `timeout` guard plugin config or system default) - `inst-lifecycle-2`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** data event (SSE event, WebSocket message, WebTransport stream data) - `inst-lifecycle-3`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Reset idle timer - `inst-lifecycle-3a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** destination is not ready to receive (backpressure) - `inst-lifecycle-3b`
      1. [ ] - `p1` - Apply async backpressure: pause reading from source until destination is ready (TCP flow control) - `inst-lifecycle-3b1`
   3. [ ] - `p1` - Forward data to the appropriate destination - `inst-lifecycle-3c`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** idle timer expires (no data in either direction) - `inst-lifecycle-4`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Transition to `CLOSING` state - `inst-lifecycle-4a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Initiate protocol-appropriate close (SSE: close response stream; WebSocket: send Close frame 1001; WebTransport: close session) - `inst-lifecycle-4b`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** upstream signals close (EOF, Close frame, session close) - `inst-lifecycle-5`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Transition to `CLOSING` state - `inst-lifecycle-5a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Propagate close to caller - `inst-lifecycle-5b`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** caller disconnects - `inst-lifecycle-6`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Transition to `CLOSING` state - `inst-lifecycle-6a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Abort upstream connection - `inst-lifecycle-6b`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** connection error (TCP reset, TLS error, protocol violation) - `inst-lifecycle-7`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Transition to `CLOSED` state immediately - `inst-lifecycle-7a`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Notify the non-errored side (if still connected) - `inst-lifecycle-7b`
8. [ ] - `p1` - Release all connection resources (sockets, buffers, timers) - `inst-lifecycle-8`
9. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** final connection state - `inst-lifecycle-9`

## 4. States (CDSL)

Not applicable. Streaming connections are transient request-scoped sessions — each connection is independent and does not persist gateway-side state between sessions. Runtime connection states (OPEN, CLOSING, CLOSED) are managed within `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-streaming-connection-lifecycle` and do not represent a persistent entity lifecycle.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Implement SSE Streaming Proxy

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-dod-sse-streaming`

The system **MUST** detect SSE responses (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`) from upstream and forward events to the caller in real time without buffering the full response. SSE fields (`data:`, `event:`, `id:`, `retry:`) **MUST** be preserved as-is. Individual SSE events are forwarded without size validation (pass-through; upstream controls event granularity). The system **MUST** handle connection lifecycle: upstream close (clean EOF), caller disconnect (abort upstream), unexpected drop (502 StreamAborted), and idle timeout (504 IdleTimeout). Non-SSE responses from an upstream expected to return SSE **MUST** return 502 ProtocolError with `X-OAGW-Error-Source: gateway`. Error source distinction per `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-error-source` applies to all streaming error scenarios.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-oagw-flow-streaming-sse`
- `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-streaming-connection-lifecycle`

**Touches**:
- API: `{METHOD} /api/oagw/v1/proxy/{alias}/{path}` (streaming variant)

### Implement WebSocket Streaming Proxy

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-dod-websocket-streaming`

The system **MUST** handle HTTP Upgrade (`Upgrade: websocket`) by negotiating the WebSocket handshake with both the caller and upstream. Messages (text and binary frames) **MUST** be forwarded bidirectionally with opcode preservation. **IF** a configurable max frame size is set, messages exceeding the limit **MUST** trigger Close frame 1009 (Message Too Big); by default, no per-message size limit is enforced (pass-through). Close frames **MUST** be propagated with status code and reason; Close frame reason strings **MUST NOT** include internal gateway details (use standard WebSocket status codes only). The system **MUST** handle unexpected disconnects: upstream drop (send 1006 Abnormal Closure to caller), caller drop (send Close to upstream), idle timeout (send 1001 Going Away to both sides). Auth and guard plugins **MUST** execute before the upgrade handshake. Transform plugins are NOT executed on individual WebSocket frames. Upstream rejection of the upgrade **MUST** return 502 ProtocolError with `X-OAGW-Error-Source: gateway`.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-oagw-flow-streaming-websocket`
- `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-streaming-connection-lifecycle`

**Touches**:
- API: `GET /api/oagw/v1/proxy/{alias}/{path}` (WebSocket upgrade)

### Implement WebTransport Streaming Proxy

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-dod-webtransport-streaming`

The system **MUST** handle WebTransport session establishment via extended CONNECT with `:protocol` pseudo-header. Session setup **MUST** require HTTP/2 minimum (verified via `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-protocol-version-negotiation`); failure to negotiate HTTP/2 **MUST** return 502 ProtocolError. Multiplexed streams (unidirectional and bidirectional) **MUST** be forwarded between caller and upstream. Session close **MUST** propagate error codes and close all open streams. Auth and guard plugins **MUST** execute before session establishment.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-oagw-flow-streaming-webtransport`
- `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-streaming-connection-lifecycle`

**Touches**:
- API: `CONNECT /api/oagw/v1/proxy/{alias}/{path}` (WebTransport session)

### Implement HTTP Version Negotiation and Protocol Cache

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-oagw-dod-protocol-version-cache`

The system **MUST** implement adaptive per-host HTTP version detection using ALPN during TLS handshake. On first connection to an upstream host, the system **MUST** offer both `h2` and `http/1.1` via ALPN. The negotiated version **MUST** be cached per `{scheme}://{host}:{port}` with a 1-hour TTL. Subsequent requests to the same host **MUST** use the cached version. On TLS handshake failure, the system **MUST** return 502 DownstreamError. Cache eviction **MUST** occur after TTL expiry. Additionally, if a request fails due to a protocol-level error on a cached version (e.g., HTTP/2 connection error on a host cached as HTTP/2-capable), the cache entry **MUST** be evicted so the next request re-negotiates via ALPN (current request is not retried per `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-no-retry`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-oagw-algo-protocol-version-negotiation`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Upstream` (protocol field), `ServerConfig`, `Endpoint`

- [ ] Protocol version cache entries are evicted on protocol-level errors (re-negotiation on next request)

## 7. Additional Context

### Performance Considerations

Streaming connections are forwarded at the TCP/TLS level with no per-event processing overhead beyond frame forwarding. SSE events, WebSocket messages, and WebTransport stream data are passed through as-is without buffering the full response body. The protocol version cache eliminates redundant ALPN negotiation for subsequent requests to the same host (1h TTL). Connection resources (sockets, buffers, timers) are released immediately on session end to prevent resource leaks under high concurrency.

**Backpressure**: When one side of a streaming connection produces data faster than the other side can consume, OAGW relies on TCP flow control (receive window backpressure) to pause the fast sender. No application-level buffering beyond OS socket buffers is performed. This prevents unbounded memory growth under asymmetric throughput conditions.

### Security Considerations

All streaming connections are subject to the same auth and guard plugin chain as regular proxy requests — authentication and authorization are enforced before any upgrade or session establishment. HTTPS-only constraint (`cpt-cf-oagw-constraint-https-only`) applies to all streaming upstream connections. Credential isolation per `cpt-cf-oagw-principle-cred-isolation` is maintained — secrets are resolved from `cred_store` at connection time and never logged or stored. WebSocket and WebTransport sessions do not re-authenticate after the initial handshake (session-scoped auth).

**Input validation**: SSE events and WebSocket/WebTransport frames are forwarded as-is (pass-through proxy). Per-message size limits are not enforced by default — the upstream controls payload granularity. An optional max WebSocket frame size can be configured per upstream/route; oversized messages result in Close frame 1009 (Message Too Big). WebSocket Close frame reason strings **MUST NOT** include internal gateway details to prevent information leakage.

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Scope | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `streaming_idle_timeout_seconds` | upstream / route | Inherited from `timeout` guard plugin or system default | Idle timeout for streaming connections (no data in either direction) |
| `websocket_max_frame_size_bytes` | upstream / route | None (pass-through) | Optional max WebSocket message size; exceeding triggers Close 1009 |
| `websocket_close_timeout_seconds` | system | 5 | Timeout for WebSocket Close frame handshake |
| `protocol_version_cache_ttl_seconds` | system | 3600 (1 hour) | TTL for cached ALPN negotiation results per host |

All parameters are read from upstream/route configuration at connection time. System-level defaults are set via module configuration (`OagwConfig`).

### Deliberate Omissions

- **States section**: Not applicable — streaming connections are transient request-scoped sessions with no persistent entity lifecycle. Runtime connection states are managed within the connection lifecycle algorithm.
- **gRPC streaming**: Out of scope — gRPC support (server, client, bidirectional streaming) is future work. See `cpt-cf-oagw-adr-grpc-support`.
- **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**: Out of scope — QUIC-native WebTransport is future work. Current WebTransport support uses HTTP/2 extended CONNECT.
- **Rate limiting during streaming**: Out of scope — rate limiting on streaming connections (e.g., per-event or per-message throttling) belongs to `cpt-cf-oagw-feature-rate-limiting`.
- **Metrics and audit logging for streaming**: Out of scope — streaming-specific metrics (connection duration, message counts, bytes transferred) belong to `cpt-cf-oagw-feature-observability`.
- **UX/Accessibility**: Not applicable — OAGW is a backend API module with no user interface.
- **Compliance/Privacy**: OAGW does not handle PII directly. Credential isolation via `cred_store` references covers data protection. No additional regulatory compliance beyond standard platform requirements.
